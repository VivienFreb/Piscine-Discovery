## Hello There 👋

### Values

There are 3 types of values, and they can model the **WORLD** !\
_(In the end it's all `1`'s and `0`'s for the computer)_, but us, **humans**, need
an easier way of representing stuff.

> We can all agree that `11010001100101110110011011001101111` is not a very
> friendly way to say `'hello'` !

#### Numbers 🔢

- Whole numbers: `1`, `23`, `232139283`
- Negative numbers are prefixed with `-`: `-1`, `-1231`
- Decimal numbers: `3.14`, `-2.53343` etc...

Use them for _quantities_ like in daily life.

#### Booleans ✖️ / ✔️

- Something is `true`
- or `false`

They represent a truth, an answer to a closed-ended question _(anything that can
be answered with yes or no)_:

- Is paris the capital of France ? `true`
- Are you born before 1723 ? `false`
- Is your screen turned on ? `true` _(most likely)_

#### Strings 🆒

- `'Hello'`
- `'This is some text'`

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text, it needs
**delimiters** to define its _begining_ and _end_.\
Delimiters are matching quotes, either `` ` ``, `"` or `'`.

### Using `console.log`

To display output from a script into a console, use the function `console.log`:

```js
console.log() // <- will show an empty line
```

Add any value between the parentheses to see it appear when the script is
executed.

> more it is tested, the easier it is to understand what's going on in the code

> In doubt, `console.log` everything, don't be shy, they are for free.

### Instructions

Using the code editor on the right of this page, 
create within `hello-there.js` a program that displays:
- the exact text `Hello There !`
- any `Number` 
- and a `Boolean`.

Videos designed to give **hints** are assigned to each quest. It is strongly suggested to watch them as you go.
